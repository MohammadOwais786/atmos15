                                <p style="font-size:20px;">Do you love following a fixed protocol and rules to problem solving? Maybe you use certain steps to decipher that logic? Algomaniac is just the place for you. The “certain steps”, i.e. algorithms are at the crux of this annual event. But if you’ve answered the questions asked above in negative, do not worry! The event also aims at testing the logic, common sense and implementation methods of the participants.</p>
                                <h2>Algomaniac consists of two rounds:</h2>
                                <p>Round 1: - This round consists of riddles and puzzles. Of course, how can you be good at algorithms unless you are good at puzzles .No knowledge of algorithms is required for this round. Anyone can participate.</p>
                                <p>SRound 2:- Now, as we know that you are good at algorithms, let’s get serious, this is the final round. This round consists of 9-10 questions.</p>
                                <h2>Event Rules and Guidelines:</h2>
                                <p>1. Bring your own Pens.</p>
                                <p>2. The number of people getting through to the second round is completely based on the performance of the candidates in the first round. The final decision on the number of candidates qualifying for the second round is solely the decision of the Organizer.</p>

Algo-Mech is a pre-Atmos event conducted in association with the Mechanical Association of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. For all physics freak out there who love to decorate pages and pages with simultaneous equations that could drive anyone crazy, this is one event that you cannot miss! You will be given a Physics challenge and will be expected to give an appropriate algorithm to solve the program efficiently.</p>
                                <h2>Specification:</h2>
                                <p>You are not required to know any programming language. Simple algorithms which can be supported by words in plain English will also do. However the ones who provide us with more readable algorithms will be awarded more points than the ones who do not.</p>

                                <p style="font-size:20px;">Program-math is another pre-ATMOS event conducted which will be conducted online. For all mathematical genii, it’s time for you to run the extra mile. The event provides the ideal amalgam of math and coding to achieve complex solutions. You'll be faced with pure mathematical questions but with values large enough for you to use the computer. Convert the mathematical logic into a code to realize the solution. In addition to it the event is online so you can comfortably answer and win from far afield.</p>
                                <h2>Specification:</h2>
                                <p>Programming language is no bar as you do not have to show us the solution. Just give the final answer to the mathematical problem (mostly an integer).</p>
                                <h2>Judging Criteria:</h2>
                                <p>Total 10 questions, each question will have a different weightage, you will be evaluated on the basis of your final score. Qualifiers from this competition would be chosen to spar with the 1st round qualifiers of Code Jam with direct entry to the 2nd round of Code Jam.</p>
                                <h2>Event Rules:</h2>
                                <p>1. Participants would be told about the online platform on which the event would be held. The participants have to join the platform as well as subscribe to the event. No late entry request would be entertained.</p>
                                <p>2. The choice of which online platform to use is solely restricted to the event organizers.</p>
                                <p>3. The score of each person at the end of contest timings would be considered. No issues related to late submission or slow compilation would be entertained.</p>
                                <p>4. The code will not be checked. Just give us the answer.</p>

                                <p style="font-size:20px;">The classic Paper presentation is one event that is not to be missed. Paper Presentation at ATMOS provides people from all over India to present us with their ideas, research and their thoughts related to new, emerging technologies or the significance of older ones in the current context. Specifically, the event comprises of two rounds. In the first round, participants are invited to send us the abstract as well as the paper they want to present through email. These entries would go through extensive cross-checking for plagiarism, creativity and choice of topic. Participants selected in this round would be eligible for the second round which is the on-site round to be conducted during ATMOS 2015 at BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus. The participants would have to provide a presentation in front of a panel, comprising of distinguished faculty, concerning the details of their paper.</p>
                                <h2>Event Rules:</h2>
                                <p>1. Participants should send the abstracts of their papers to voxcsa@gmail.com</p>
                                <p>2. Plagiarism up to 30% is tolerated.</p>
                                <p>3. Participants selected for the second round must create a formal presentation concerning their paper. Any other form would not be accepted.</p>
                                <h2>Judging Criteria:</h2>
                                <p>The first round be judged on the basis of the idea or field chosen by the participants. Fields having real life implementations would be preferred. The abstract sent by the participant would be checked for correctness as well as plagiarism. PLEASE AVOID PLAGIARISM. The second round would be based on the presentation of the participant with the judging procedure entirely selected by the panel as such.</p>

Come October and BITS-Pilani,Hyderabad Campus will be all set to fulfil your dream,well,in a way.On the line of the ecstatic Moto GP competition,we are conducting The Mini GP competition.The competition will have its participants (or racers) drive self-designed remote controlled cars through deliciously twisty race tracks to win the final cup! Seems simple?Well, brace yourselves for some rock solid competition. Forget not, the more innovative and inventive your design is, the closer you are to the Mini GP cup.Fasten your seatbelts and let the adrenaline pump up!</p>
							                                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
							                                <p style="font-size:20px;">The participants are expected to race their remote control based IC engine cars through tracks whose complexity is bound to increase level after level.The teams completing the laps in the best possible time will qualify for a grand final race.The design skills and application of real-world driving skills to the miniature cars are put to test.
							</p>
							                                <h2>Competition Rules
							</h2>
							                                <p style="font-size:20px;"></p><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>	The track will have check points at regular intervals.</li>
							<li>	In case a machine tumbles, or halts, or goes off the arena at any point on the track, only one of the participants is allowed to lift it up and place it at the nearest checkpoint behind that point. (Previous two rules are for non-racing rounds. The rules for racing round will be told on the spot)</li>
							<li>Until and unless there is a need to touch the vehicle as stated above, they have to be fully remot3e controlled throughout the rave.</li>
							<li>Every time the machine requires lifting by the team member, a time-penalty will be imposed.</li>
							<li>Any vehicle is not allowed to leave any disintegrated part on the race track amidst of the race. In case this happens, the team will be disqualified.</li>
							<li>The teams are also not allowed to damage the opponent\'s vehicle deliberately. If found guilty, the accused team will be disqualified.</li>
							<li>There will be a time-penalty for reverse gearing.</li>
							<li>Teams may consist of a maximum of 5 members.</li>
							</ul>
							<p></p>
							                                <h2>Judging Criteria</h2>
							                                <p style="font-size:20px;"></p><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>Participants are expected to design their own racing car. However, in case the participants use readymade cars, they will only be evaluated for 3/4th of the total marks. That is a penalty if 1/4th of the total marks will be levied on them. If their car is part self-designed and part readymade, then the marks will be given accordingly as per the judge's discretion. Above mentioned penalty is not applicable for the final round.
							                                </li><li>Driving ability and application skills of the participant will also be put to test.
							</li>
							                               <li>Lap time will be another criterion to decide the winner.
							</li></ul><p></p>
							<h2>Vehicle Specifications</h2>
							                                <p></p><ul style="list-style-type:disc"><li>The vehicle should be designed so that it fits in an 800mm X 700 mm box at every given point of time in the race. This is excluding the remote controller.</li>
							                                <li>It is essential that the car be designed with an internal combustion engine (IC engine). Motors etc. should not be the main driving sources of the car. However, for steering mechanisms or any other mechanism apart from propulsion DC motors and servos can be used. </li>

							                                <li>Only one IC engine should be used in the vehicle. Use of any other sources such as chemicals, compressed gas, rockets etc. for propulsion is not allowed. The allowed capacity of IC engine to be used is 4.5 cc or less.
							</li>
							<li>	
							The vehicle has to be necessarily controlled by a wireless remote control system throughout the competition. The vehicle must have two remote controllers of different frequencies or an alternate frequency remote control circuit which can be switched to either frequency before the start of the game. This is done to avoid frequency interference between the two competing vehicles.
							</li>                               
							<li>Remote control systems from toys or the ones purchased from a market might be used without any fear of penalization.
							</li>    
							<li>The vehicle parts can be ready made. But there will be extra points if you make chassis and steering mechanism by yourself (See judging criteria for more detail).
							If you are making your car then other functional parts like motors and servos, gears, springs, engine, remote control systems, batteries, wheels, braking mechanism are allowed to be used as directly available from the market.
							</li>    
							<li>It is essential that the vehicle has an onboard power supply to provide electricity to any mechanism requiring electric power.
							</li><li>Electric voltage not more than 12V should be used in the machine wherever required.
							</li><li>Participants are advised to use a proper cooling mechanism to prevent overheating of the engine.
							</li>
							<li>Verify with the organizers if you have the slightest doubt whether a component can be used or not. Please do not hesitate. Designs not complying with the vehicle specifications will be disqualified.
							</li></ul><p></p>

									                                 </div><h2>About Smart Cities</h2>
									                                <p style="font-size:20px;"> "Smart city" has emerged as a buzzword in India ever since Prime Minister Narendra Modi outlined his vision for creating a hundred Smart cities. And, aside from the hype around the term "Smart cities" it does raise some pertinent questions such as what does it really mean to be a "smart city?" and why should Indians care about the smartness of their city? Indian cities are unique in that they confront the challenges of not only the 20th and 21st centuries but also some remnants from the 19th century. While cities like Bengaluru are participants in global innovation and increasingly compete with Silicon Valley to further enhance innovation, they also need to tackle important issues such as providing basic sanitation, public transport, clean water and effective waste management. So, the traditional approach of managing and maintaining our cities must change - both in mindset and in the way we administer them.</p>
									                                <h2>Call for City Innovations</h2>
									                                <p> There is tremendous potential in India to build an effective ecosystem to enable our burgeoning urban areas to become smart by using digital technology. This in turn will create employment opportunities and contribute to economic growth through innovation. Our cities are fast becoming the defining units of human habitation. How smartly we build, manage and operate our cities will be the single biggest determinant of our people's future. We owe it to our future generations to make our cities smart through the use of technology. <br>
									We request all the Public and Private bodies to join hands and show their mettle by coming up with smart, sustainable and long-term solutions. Applicants will be invited to present and showcase their technology during the National Techno-Management Fest of BITS Pilani Hyderabad Campus, ATMOS 2015(October 8-12, 2015). <b>"There is no fee to submit your innovation".</b> </p>
